    <p>I took the site down, because why support stuff you no longer believe in? Why get stuck imagining yourself to be a particular way -- old, young, short, tall, clever, stupid? You are so much more than that. Your potential is limitless.

    <p>Anyone can transform themselves at every moment. Everyone has the dark and the light, the hero and the coward, the warrior and the thief.
    </p>
    <p>This is about discovering what you are.
